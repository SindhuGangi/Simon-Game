🧩 Simon Game

🎮 Overview

The Simon Game is a classic memory-based pattern game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery).
The game tests and improves your short-term memory by generating a sequence of colors that you must repeat in the same order. Each round adds one more color to the sequence, increasing the challenge and excitement.

 

🧠 How the Game Works
	1.	Start the Game — Press any key to begin.
	2.	Watch the Sequence — A random color will flash; remember it.
	3.	Repeat It — Click the buttons in the same order as shown.
	4.	Level Up — If you repeat correctly, the sequence grows longer.
	5.	Game Over — If you click the wrong color, the screen flashes red and the game restarts.
